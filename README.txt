These are example python programs for working with GPIO on the Raspberry Pi released after December 2012.

This is for the Raspberry Pi class that we teach at The Hack Factory, http://tcmaker.org.

If you want the presentation that goes along with this, please feel free to email me and I can send along what I've been using to teach the classes.

The "CatFeeder" directory contains all the programs to get started doing at least a manual cat feed.
