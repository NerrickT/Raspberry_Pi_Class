These are example python programs for working with GPIO on the Raspberry Pi released after December 2012 (Version 2).

This is for the Raspberry Pi class that I teach.

If you want the presentation that goes along with this, please feel free to email me and I can send along what I've been using to teach the classes.

The "CatFeeder" directory contains all the programs to get started doing cat feeding.
